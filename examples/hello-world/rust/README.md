# Hello World Boilermaker Template 

This is the most basic template that Boilermaker has to offer. It demonstrates the following:

- How to set up a proper `boilermaker.toml` template configuration
- How directory structure (`template/`) is copied into your new project 
- How basic variable interpolation works by rendering a `welcome_message` variable into `main.rs`

That's about it!

> TODO: make following instructions work
